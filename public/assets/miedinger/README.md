Miedinger*
=========

Miedinger* is based on the work of Max Miedinger. 
Initially I set out to make as faithful a replicant of Helvetica as possible. I have since had a change of heart and elected to scrap the current font and design a new, Helvetica-inspired one. I did, however, finish creating two weights before this change of heart, which are available.
